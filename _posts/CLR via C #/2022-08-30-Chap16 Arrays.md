Arrays are always **reference types** that are allocated on the **managed heap**.

The following code declares and creates an array of 100 Int32 values. All of the Int32s are initialized to 0, and allocated on the managed heap. \
In addition to the array’s elements, the memory block occupied by an array object also contains a type object pointer, a sync block index, and some additional overhead members as well.
```c#
Int32[] myIntegers; 
myIntegers = new Int32[100];
```

Create multiple-dimensional arrays
```c#
// Create a two­ dimensional array of Doubles.
Double[,] myDoubles = new Double[10, 20];

// Create a three ­dimensional array of String references.
String[,,] myStrings = new String[5, 3, 10];
```

CLR also supports jagged arrays, which are arrays of arrays.
```c#
// Create a single­dimensional array of Point arrays.
Point[][] myPolygons = new Point[3][];

// myPolygons[0] refers to an array of 10 Point instances.
myPolygons[0] = new Point[10];

// myPolygons[1] refers to an array of 20 Point instances.
myPolygons[1] = new Point[20];

// myPolygons[2] refers to an array of 30 Point instances.
myPolygons[2] = new Point[30];

// Display the Points in the first polygon.
for (Int32 x = 0; x < myPolygons[0].Length; x++)
    Console.WriteLine(myPolygons[0][x]);
```

## Initializing Array Elements

These following statements are valid.
```c#
var names = new String[] { "Aidan", "Grant" };

var names = new[] { "Aidan", "Grant", null };

String[] names = { "Aidan", "Grant" };
```

Even, we can use implicitly typed arrays with anonymous types and implicitly typed local variables. 
```c#
// Using C#’s implicitly typed local, implicitly typed array, and anonymous type features:
var kids = new[] {new { Name="Aidan" }, new { Name="Grant" }};

// Sample usage (with another implicitly typed local variable):
foreach (var kid in kids)
    Console.WriteLine(kid.Name);
```

## Casting Arrays

When casting an array type to another, both array types must have same dimensions, and an implicit or explicit conversion must exist.

CLR does NOT allow to cast an array with value type elements to any other type. We can use **Array.Copy** method to accomplish it.

```c#
// Create a two­dimensional FileStream array.
FileStream[,] fs2dim = new FileStream[5, 10];

// Implicit cast to a two­dimensional Object array
Object[,] o2dim = fs2dim;

// Can't cast from two ­dimensional array to one­ dimensional array
// Compiler error
Stream[] s1dim = (Stream[]) o2dim;

// Explicit cast to two­dimensional Stream array
Stream[,] s2dim = (Stream[,]) o2dim;
```

The Copy method can perform the following conversions:
+ Box value type elements to reference type elements, e.g., copy int[] to Object[]
+ Unbox reference type elements to value type elements, e.g., copy Object[] to int[]
+ Widen primitive value types, e.g., copy int[] to double[]
+ Downcast elements. If every object in the Object[] implements IFormattable, we can cast from an Object[] to an IFormattable[]

```c#
// Define a value type that implements an interface.
internal struct MyValueType : IComparable {
    public Int32 CompareTo(Object obj) {
        ...
    } 
}

public static class Program {
    public static void Main() {
        MyValueType[] src = new MyValueType[100];
        IComparable[] dest = new IComparable[src.Length];
        Array.Copy(src, dest, src.Length);
    } 
}
```

## All Arrays Are Implicitly Derived from System.Array

This makes working with arrays extremely convenient, because System.Array type defines a lot of helpful methods and properties, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array?view=net-6.0

## All Arrays Implicitly Implement IEnumerable, ICollection, and IList

CLR performs a little trick: when a single-dimensional array type is created, CLR automatically make the array implement IEnumerable\<T>, ICollection\<T>, IList\<T> interfaces, and also implements these interfaces for array type's base type **as long as they are refernece type** (value type NOT).

For example, if we have following code:
```c#
FileStream[] fsArray;
```
We can call following methods:
```c#
void M1(IList<FileStream> fsList) { ... }
void M2(ICollection<Stream> sCollection) { ... }
void M3(IEnumerable<Object> oEnumerable) { ... }
```
