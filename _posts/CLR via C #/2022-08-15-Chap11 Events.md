A type that defines an **event** member allows the type (or instance) to notify other objects that something special has happened.

For example, the **Button** class offers an event called **Click**. When a **Button** object is clicked, one or more objects in an application may receive notification about this event in order to perform some action.

CLR's event model is based on **delegates** (see Chapter 17 later).

# Designing a Type that Exposes an Event

Let's say that we want to design an email application. We will first design a type called **MailManager** that receives the incoming email messages. **MailManager** will expose an event called **NewMail**. \
Other types (such as **Fax** and **Pager**) may register interest in this event. When **MailManager** receives a new email message, it will raise the event, causing the message to be distributed to the registered objects. Each object can process the message.

There are many steps a developer must take in order to define a type that exposes one or more event members. We will walk through each of the necessary steps (Event Source, Event, Event Subscriber, Event Handler, Subscribes). 

## Step #1: Define a type that hold any additional information that sent to receivers of the event notification (Event Args)

When an event is raised, the object raising the event may want to pass some additional information to the event receiver. 

This additional information needs to be encapsulated into its own class. By convention, classes that hold event informations should be derived from **System.EventArgs**, and the class name should be suffixed with **EventArgs**. 

In this example, the **NewMailEventArgs** class has fields identifying who sent the message (m_from), who is receiving the message (m_to), and the subject of message (m_subject).
```c#
// Step #1: Define a type that will hold any event information that sent to receivers
internal class NewMailEventArgs : EventArgs {

    private readonly String m_from, m_to, m_subject;

    public NewMailEventArgs(String from, String to, String subject) {
        m_from = from; 
        m_to = to; 
        m_subject = subject;
    }
   
    public String From    { get { return m_from; } }
    public String To      { get { return m_to; } }
    public String Subject { get { return m_subject; } }
}
```

The base class **EventArgs** is defined in .NET Framework class library, and is implemented like the following. \
It simply serves as a base type from which other types can derive. When you define an event that doesn’t have any additional data to pass, just use **EventArgs.Empty** rather than constructing a new **EventArgs** object.
```c#
[ComVisible(true), Serializable]
public class EventArgs {
    public static readonly EventArgs Empty = new EventArgs();
    public EventArgs() {  }
}
```

## Step #2: Define the event member (Event Source, Event)

Here is what the event member in our **MailManager** class looks like.
```c#
internal class MailManager {
    // Step #2: Define the event member
    public event EventHandler<NewMailEventArgs> NewMail;
    ...
}
```

The type of the event member is **EventHandler\<New­ MailEventArgs>**, which means that all receivers of the event must supply a callback method whose prototype matches that of the **EventHandler\<NewMailEventArgs>** delegate type. \
Because the generic **System.EventHandler** delegate is defined as follows. 
```c#
public delegate void EventHandler<TEventArgs>(Object sender, TEventArgs e);
```
the method prototypes must look like the following.
```c#
void MethodName(Object sender, NewMailEventArgs e);
```

## Step #3: Define a method responsible for raising the event to notify registered objects

By convention, the class should define a **protected and virtual** method, which takes one parameter **NewMailEventArgs** object.

Here is what the method in our **MailManager** class looks like.
```c#
internal class MailManager {
    ...
    // Step #3: Define a method responsible for raising the event
    // to notify registered objects that the event has occurred
    // If this class is sealed, make this method private and nonvirtual
    protected virtual void OnNewMail(NewMailEventArgs e) {
        // Copy a reference to the delegate field now into a temporary field for thread safety
        EventHandler<NewMailEventArgs> temp = Volatile.Read(ref NewMail);
        // If any methods registered interest with our event, notify them
        if (temp != null) temp(this, e);
    }
    ... 
}
```

## Step #4: Define a method that translates the input into the desired event

Your class must have some method that takes some input and translates it into the raising of the event. 

In my **MailManager** example, the **SimulateNewMail** method is called to indicate that a new email message has arrived into **MailManager**.
```c#
 internal class MailManager {
    // Step #4: Define a method that translates the input into the desired event
    public void SimulateNewMail(String from, String to, String subject) {
        // Construct an object to hold the information
        NewMailEventArgs e = new NewMailEventArgs(from, to,subject);
        // Call virtual method notifying our object that the event
        // occurred.
        OnNewMail(e);
    } 
}
```

# How the Compiler Implements an Event

In the **MailManager** class, we have a line of code that defines the event member.
```c#
 public event EventHandler<NewMailEventArgs> NewMail;
```

When C# compiler compiles the line, it translates this single line into the following three constructs.
```c#
// 1. A PRIVATE delegate field that is initialized to null
private EventHandler<NewMailEventArgs> NewMail = null;

// 2. A PUBLIC add_Xxx method that register interest in the event.
public void add_NewMail(EventHandler<NewMailEventArgs> value) { 

}

// 3. A PUBLIC remove_Xxx method that unregister interest in the event.
public void remove_NewMail(EventHandler<NewMailEventArgs> value) {
}
```

The first construct is a field of delegate type. It refers to the head of a list of delegates that will be notified when event occurs. Registering interest in an event means adding an instance of the delegate type to the list, unregistering means removing the delegate from the list. \
The delegate field is always **private** even if the defined event is public, which is to prevent code outside the defining class from manipulating it improperly.

The second and third constructs are two methods that allows to register / unregister interest in the event. In this example, they are both **public**, because we declared the event to be public.

In addition to these constructs, compilers also emit an event definition entry into the managed assembly’s metadata, which contains some flags and the underlying delegate type, and refers to the add and remove accessor methods.

# Designing a Type that Listens for an Event (Event Subscriber, Event Handler, Subscribe )

```c#
internal sealed class Fax {

    public Fax(MailManager mm) {
       // Register callback with MailManager's NewMail event
       mm.NewMail += FaxMsg;
    }

    // MailManager will call when a new email message arrives
    private void FaxMsg(Object sender, NewMailEventArgs e) {
        Console.WriteLine("Faxing mail message:");
        Console.WriteLine("From={0}, To={1}, Subject={2}", e.From, e.To, e.Subject);
    }

    // Unregister event so that it no longer receives notifications
    public void Unregister(MailManager mm) {
       mm.NewMail -­= FaxMsg;
    }
}
```
